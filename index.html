  <h2>Chapter 7 Statistical Inference and Tests of Inference</h2>
  <h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>In social sciences, biology, or any field...we have a slight problem with the need to generalize about groups. Sometimes, the groups are too large and we can&#39;t find everyone, it could be cost prohibitive in both terms of time and money, etc. So, how can we study a smaller representation of a larger group that we may not be able to study in it&#39;s entirety. To accomplish this fundamental aspect of research....we can take a representative and random sample from a population. We then can use probability theory to make a decision about the hypothesis that we wish to test.</p>

<p>Now when we talk about statistics, we can keep this in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>P</strong>arameter is to a <strong>P</strong>opulation as a <strong>S</strong>tatistic is to a <strong>S</strong>ample</li>

  <h2>Statistical Inference</h2>
  <p>Statistical inference is achieved by using tests of statistical significance, or techniques that help us to generalize to a larger group.</p>

<p>A <strong>P</strong>arameter is to a <strong>P</strong>opulation as a <strong>S</strong>tatistic is to a <strong>S</strong>ample</p>

<ul>
<li>Sample: group of subjects in a study</li>
<li>Population: All possible subjects that we intend to learn about</li>
<li>Probabilities are theoretical...

<ul>
<li>They are expectations of what will happen</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actual trials are empirical

<ul>
<li>They are actually what does happen </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Equally Likely Model – all outcomes are equally likely of occurring </li>
<li>Mutually Exclusive Outcomes – outcome of one trial is independent of the outcome on any other trial</li>
<li>Mutually Exhaustive Outcomes - we account for all possible outcomes in a scenario. </li>
</ul>

  <h2>Statistical Inference.... Not a problem.</h2>
  <p>Eleanor scores 680 on the Mathematics part of the SAT. The distribution of SAT scores in a reference population is Normal, with mean 500 and standard deviation 100. Gerald takes the American College Testing (ACT) Mathematics test and scores 27. ACT scores are Normally distributed with mean 18 and standard deviation 6. Assuming that both tests measure the same kind of ability, who did better?</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Eleanor</em></li>
<li>Gerald</li>
</ol>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>We need to standardize the scores to make the comparison for the informed decision.</p>

<ul>
<li>Eleanor \[z_E = \frac{680 - 500}{100} = 1.8\]</li>
<li>Gerald \[z_G = \frac{27 - 18}{6} = 1.5\]</li>
</ul>

<p>Since, Eleanor has a higher standardized score, we can conclude that Eleanor did better!</p>

  <h2>Statistical Inference ... a few more words.</h2>
  <p>Consider this type of question:</p>

<p>Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.</p>

<p>Which is more probable?</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Linda is a bank teller.</em></li>
<li>Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Hint</h4>

<p>Think about the probabilities of each event, and that of both of them together.</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>

<p>If you selected 2, step back and think. Suppose we denote the event of Linda being a teller by A and the event she is active in the feminist movement by B, then probabilities in question can be written as.</p>

<ul>
<li>P(A)</li>
<li>\(P(A \cap B)\)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy">conjugacy fallacy</a> that occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.</p>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="inf3">
  <h2>Sampling</h2>
  <p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>A pollster is sure that the responses to his “agree/disagree” question will follow a binomial distribution, but p, the proportion of those who “agree” in the population, is unknown.</li>
<li>An agronomist believes that the yield per acre of a variety of wheat is approximately normally distributed, but the mean m and the standard deviation s of the yields are unknown.</li>
<li>If you want the sample to provide reliable information about the population, you must select your sample in a certain way!</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="sampling">
  <h2>Sampling</h2>
  <ul>
<li><p>Sampling Error – differences between two samples that are attributed to random error or chance </p></li>
<li><p>Significant Differences – differences between two samples that are attributed to an outside factor such as an IV </p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Brief Intro to the Central Limit Theorem and Sampling</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Next week we will cover this in more detail, but for now:</p></li>
<li><p>Central Limit Theorem – the means of an infinite number of samples drawn from the same population will approximate a normal distribution </p></li>
<li><p>The mean of this distribution, called the sampling distribution of the mean, is equal to the mean of the population </p></li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="sampling2">
  <h2>Sampling Distribution</h2>
  <p>Definition: The <strong>sampling distribution</strong> of a statistic is the probability distribution for the possible values of the statistic that results when random samples of size n are repeatedly drawn from the population.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Population: 3, 5, 2, 1</p>

<ul>
<li>Draw samples of size n = 3 without replacement</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Possible Samples:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="sampling_pop.png" alt="width"> 
<img src="sampling_pop1.png" alt="width"></p>

<p>Each value of x-bar is equally likely, with probability 1/4</p>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="sampling3">
  <h2>Random Samples</h2>
  <ul>
<li>The sampling plan or experimental design determines the amount of information you can extract, and often allows you to measure the reliability of your inference.</li>
<li>Simple random sampling is a method of sampling that allows each possible sample of size n an equal probability of being selected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Random Samples</h3>

<p>Sampling can occur in two types of practical situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Observational studies: The data existed before you decided to study it. Watch out for

<ul>
<li>Nonresponse: Are the responses biased because only opinionated people responded?
*Undercoverage: Are certain segments of the population systematically excluded?</li>
<li>Wording bias: The question may be too complicated or poorly worded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Experimentation: The data are generated by imposing an experimental condition or treatment on the experimental units. 
*Hypothetical populations can make random sampling difficult if not impossible.

<ul>
<li>Samples must sometimes be chosen so that the experimenter believes they are representative of the whole population. </li>
<li>Samples must behave like random samples!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stratified random sample:  Divide the population into sub populations or strata and select a simple random sample from each strata.</li>
<li>Cluster sample: Divide the population into subgroups called clusters; select a simple random sample of clusters and take a census of every element in the cluster.</li>
<li>1-in-k systematic sample: Randomly select one of the first k elements in an ordered population, and then select every k-th element thereafter.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="random">
  <h2>More Examples</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Divide California into counties and take a simple random sample within each county.

<ul>
<li>Stratified</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Divide California into counties and take a simple random sample of 10 counties.

<ul>
<li>Clustered
Divide a city into city blocks, choose a simple random sample of 10 city blocks, and interview all who live there.</li>
<li>Clustered
Choose an entry at random from the phone book, and select every 50th number thereafter. </li>
<li>1 in 50 Systematic</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section class="slide class" id="random2">
  <h2>Non-Random Sampling Plans: Not used for statistical inference</h2>
  <ul>
<li><p>Can be used for data mining</p></li>
<li><p>Convenience sample:  A sample that can be taken easily without random selection.</p>

<ul>
<li>People walking by on the street</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Judgment sample: The sampler decides who will and won’t be included in the sample.      </p></li>
<li><p>Quota sample: The makeup of the sample must reflect the makeup of the population on some selected characteristic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Race, ethnic origin, gender, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

  <h2>Normal Curve (Outside Textbook Information)</h2>
  <h3>...The Bell Shaped Curve...</h3>

<p>The normal curve is symmetric, bell shaped, and asymptotic. The inflection points fall at one standard deviation above and below the mean.</p>

<p><img src="normalcurve.png" alt="width"></p>

</section>
<section class="slide class" id="normal1">
  <h2>Normal Curve: Areas Under the Curve</h2>
  <p>The normal curve always has these proportions:</p>

<p><img src="normalcurveareas1.png" alt="width"></p>

<p>and </p>

<p><img src="normalcurveareas2.png" alt="width"></p>

<section class="slide class" id="normal2">
  <h2>Hypotheses</h2>
  <p>Hypothesis tests follow a logical format ...</p>

<ul>
<li>(𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑑𝑖𝑑 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑔𝑒𝑡?−𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑑𝑖𝑑 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡?)/(𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 )</li>
</ul>

<p>Z-scores have the same formula with X = what you got, M = what you expected, and s = the standardized random error </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Independent Variable (IV) – the causal variable</p>

<ul>
<li>Is typically manipulated by the researcher</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dependent Variable (DV) – the effect </p>

<ul>
<li>Is typically expected to be impacted by the IV </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Extraneous Variable (XV) or Confounding Variable (CV) – unintended variable               </p>

<ul>
<li>Impacts the DV </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Null Hypothesis – no effect of IV on DV \(\mu_x = \mu_y\)</li>
<li>Research (Alternative) Hypothesis (H1 or HA \(\mu_x ≠ \mu_y\) or \(\mu_x < \mu_y\)) – what is expected to be found </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Types of Hypotheses:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Directional – the IV is expected to ONLY increase or ONLY decrease the DV
\(\mu_x > \mu_y\) or \(\mu_x < \mu_y\) </li>
<li>Nondirectional – effect of IV could increas \(\mu_x ≠ \mu_y\) or decrease the DV </li>
</ul></li>
